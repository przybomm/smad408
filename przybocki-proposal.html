        <h1>Project Proposal: Nobis</h1>
            <p>In our country today, as a society we struggle to strive towards a collectivist society instead of the individualistic one we currently reside. Since the beginning of COVID-19, people have had to explore new, virtual outlets to connect with their family members, friends and community members just to name a few. I am proposing the idea of creating a mobile application, and that serves as a collaborative and connecting community resource called: Nobis, which is Latin for “Us”. 
            <br><br>
	       Nobis will primarily be used as a way to connect with people that live in your local community, and secondarily to connect with others who might not live close. These local connections will allow users to get to know their neighbors, offer support to those in the community, and collaborate on ways to make their community better.</p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
    
            <ul>
                <li>To create an inclusive app that allows users to control how they want to be presented in their community</li>
                <li>Avoid the default problems such as gender specific accommodations, instead create aspects that are not specific demographic driven</li>
                <li>Create an enjoyable and easy-to-use interface that is memorable to users</li>
                <li>Establish an atmosphere of welcoming and change within the app that impacts users that are using the app and outside of the app</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>Research for personas will be navigated towards finding a common user between the 20-45 age range. Gender demographics will not be taken generally to preserve the goal of this app to provide an inclusive experience. As these personas are created, they will not put users "in a box", and follow advice given in "Technically Wrong"</p>
                <p>These personas will not require excessive skill to use the application but instead basic knowledge of their smatphone functions to navigate through the app. </p>
                <p>The occupations of each persona will vary because of the diversity of age range and occupational field of a "neighborhood.</p>
